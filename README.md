PayMoney and a daily target, your task is to determine at which transaction PayMoney achieves the same. If the target is not achievable, then display the target is not achieved.
>TestCase 1\
Enter the size of transaction array\
3\
Enter the values of array\
20 12 31\
Enter the total no of targets that needs to be achieved\
2\
Enter the value of target\
21\
Target achieved after 2 transactions <br />
Enter the value of target\
19\
Target achieved after 1 transactions \
Explanation\
Target 1 i.e 21 is achieved after 2 transactions, (20 + 12)\
Target 2 i.e 19 is achieved in the 1st transaction itself.

>Test Case 2
Enter the size of transaction array\
1\
Enter the values of array\
100\
Enter the total no of targets that needs to be achieved\
1\
Enter the value of target\
101 <br />
Given target is not achieved\
Explanation â†’ Since there is only 1 transaction that is of 100 and the target value is 101, hence target is not achieved.<br />
